# Motion-detection-system
A motion-detection system built using C++ and OpenCV that identifies movement in video using frame differencing. Each frame is processed with grayscale, blur, thresholding, and contour detection to highlight motion with red bounding boxes. The output video is saved, demonstrating a simple and efficient approach to basic surveillance.
